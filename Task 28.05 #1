1. **Theoretical:** What is the difference between the INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?
In SQL, both INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN are types of join operations used to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column between them.The INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
In other words, we can say that an INNER JOIN returns the intersection of the two tables.It selects all the records from the left table and the matching records from the right table based on the specified column.If there are no matching values in the right table, 
the result will contain NULL values for the columns of the right table.To summarize, an INNER JOIN only includes the matching rows from both tables, while a LEFT JOIN includes all the rows from the left table and the matching rows 
from the right table, or NULL values if there is no match.

2. **Incomplete - Practical:** Write a SQL query to fetch the names of employees who are working under a manager with manager_id '102'.
SELECT first_name employees 
FROM employees
WHERE  manager_id  = 102;

3.**Problem-Solving**: How would you use SQL to find the department with the most number of employees?

select count(e.employee_id), d.department_name from employees e inner join departments d on e.department_id=d.department_id group by (d.department_name)  order by count(e.employee_id) desc fetch next 1 rows only;


4.**Complete - Practical:** Write a SQL query to find the names of all employees who have the job title 'Sales Representative'.
    *Hint: Use the employees table and WHERE clause to filter the job_id column.*
    
    select first_name from employees where job_id=(select job_id from jobs where job_title='Sales Representative');
    
5.*Incomplete* - Practical: Write a SQL query to get the list of all department names and the number of employees in each department.
select count(e.employee_id), d.department_name from employees e inner join departments d on e.department_id=d.department_id group by (d.department_name) ;
